<h3>My Portfolio Page</h3>
<p>My Portfolio page was my first bigger project. The idea was to show what I have learned so far, and what I can achieve with that knowledge. The page was built with "Jekyll" and "SASS". Combining these two, let's you organize and maintain your page more easely, as you'll see. </p>

<p>"Jekyll" is a static site generator, that gives you all kind of cool stuff. The first and obvious is, it makes work more organized by letting you split your page into a sections. So, the index page consist just of a bunch of includes, as show in a picture below: </p>

<p>Each include corresponds to an each section of the page. Making all more organized, and easier to find and maintain.</p>

<p> Another cool feature of Jekyll is "for" loops and variables, that lets you cut on repetition in writing code, and makes it easier to update page, later on. It does all sorts of cool stuff.

<p>Another cool technology that was used, is SASS. SASS, or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet, is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again. Just like Jekyll, in SASS, you can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain, as shown in image below:  </p>
