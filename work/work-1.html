<h3>Orbiting planets with CSS animations</h3>

<p>One of the first projects I did. In this project I demonstrated the power of CSS animations. This animated page was done only with CSS. Even though it looks like complicated animation, done with some JS, there was no javascript at all.</p>

<p>Basic HTML structure, nothing fancy here.</p>

<a href="Assets/img/work/proj-1/img-1.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="Assets/img/work/proj-1/img-1.jpg" alt="projects"></a>

<p>Animation was done with "keyframes", using the "transform" property in order to rotate the objects. Box shadow and opacity was animated so it gives a stars and sun glare illusion</p>
